# Critical Mass Project

Hi, this is a take-home project for Critical mass. As per the instructions, video and JSON file,  I have created a navigation bar, using vanilla js/html/css. 

Link for live site : https://rajhanspol.github.io/Critical-Mass-Takehome-Project/

Some points to note : 
1) Used Live server plugin on VSCode, due to local Json file.

2) Have added another key, timeZone, to the JSON file provided, to calculate time for the respective cities. As an alternative, can use google apis to get the same.

3) There was no instruction regarding responsiveness, so have kept it similar to the video. Design will have to change for smaller screens.
